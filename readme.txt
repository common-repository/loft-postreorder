== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can’t see any changes after I reordered my posts =
- If you have installed any caching plugins then clear the cache. And you may also need to clear your browser cache.

= Reordering does not apply to my category archive page =
- If the posts on your category archive page are in the “Masonry” layout (controlled by your theme or other plugin), then the reordering feature may not work as expected. Because some methods of creating a “Masonry” layout will calculate and rearrange position of the posts.
